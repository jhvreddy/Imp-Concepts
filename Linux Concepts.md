``kernel`` It is the heart of the OS, and the component responsible for communication between software and Hardware. it is responsile for 4 operations.The Linux kernel is responsible for managing system resources, such as CPU, memory, I/O devices, and network connections. It is also responsible for providing system services, such as process management, memory management, file system management, and network management

``System libraries`` Responsible for performing task

Whenever a user sends a request it has to go from your software to your operating systemto your Hardware finally the response is also received back in the same way (vice versa)
